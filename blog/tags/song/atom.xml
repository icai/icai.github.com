<p>me and my baby on a february holiday  <br />
‘cause we got the news  <br />
yeah, we got the news  <br />
500 miles and we’re gonna make it all the way  <br />
we’ve got nothing to lose  <br />
we’ve got nothing to lose  <br />
<!--more--></p>

<p>it’s been 10 years waiting  <br />
but it’s better late than the never  <br />
we’ve been told before  <br />
we can’t wait one minute more</p>

<p>oh, me and my baby driving down  <br />
to a hilly seaside town in the rainfall  <br />
oh, me and my baby stand in line  <br />
you’ve never seen a sight so fine  <br />
as the love that’s gonna shine  <br />
at city hall</p>

<p>me and my baby’ve been through  <br />
a lot of good and bad  <br />
learned to kiss the sky  <br />
made our momma’s cry  <br />
I’ve seen a lot of friends  <br />
after giving it all they had  <br />
lay down and die  <br />
lay down and die</p>

<p>10 years into it  <br />
here’s our window  <br />
at the vegas drive-thru chapel  <br />
it ain’t too much  <br />
for ‘em all to handle</p>

<p>oh, me and my baby driving down  <br />
to a hilly seaside town in the rainfall  <br />
oh, me and my baby stand in line  <br />
you’ve never seen a sight so fine  <br />
as the love that’s gonna shine  <br />
at city hall</p>

<p>outside, they’re handing out  <br />
donuts and pizza pies  <br />
for the folks in pairs in the folding chairs  <br />
my baby’s lookin’ so damned pretty  <br />
with those anxious eyes  <br />
rain-speckled hair  <br />
and my ring to wear</p>

<p>10 years waiting for this moment of fate  <br />
when we say the words and sign our names  <br />
if they take it away again someday  <br />
this beautiful thing won’t change</p>

<p>oh, me and my baby driving down  <br />
to a hilly seaside town in the rainfall  <br />
oh, me and my baby stand in line  <br />
you’ve never seen a sight so fine  <br />
as the love that’s gonna shine</p>

<p>oh, me and my baby driving down  <br />
to a hilly seaside town in the rainfall  <br />
oh, me and my baby stand in line  <br />
you’ve never seen a sight so fine  <br />
as the love that’s gonna shine  <br />
at city hall</p>
